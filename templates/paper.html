    <strong>Research Questions</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        What are the existing software effort estimation techniques? Is
        it possible to categorize?
      </li>
      <li>
        According to the literature, what are the most popular
        approaches to software estimation? Has popularity changed over
        time? Can we draw a trend across time?
      </li>
      <li>
        How have software developers used effort estimation?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do available studies provide quantitative outcomes with respect
        to effectiveness and accuracy of effort estimation techniques?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do empirical studies report engineersâ€™ perception and rationale
        about effort estimation techniques?
      </li>
    </ul>
